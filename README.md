This is the binary tree method I wrote for the assignment in course Fiancial Mathematics Spring semester 2018-2019. I implemented three kinds of binary tree methods

-CRR (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein) binary tree

Cox, J., Ross, S., & Rubinstein, M. (1979). Option Pricing A Simplified Approach. *Journal of Financial Economics, 7*, 229-264.

-Hull-White binary tree

Hull, J., & White, A. (1993). Efficient Procedures for Valuing European and American Path-dependent Options. *Journal of derivatives, 1*, 21-31.

-Singular Point binary tree
